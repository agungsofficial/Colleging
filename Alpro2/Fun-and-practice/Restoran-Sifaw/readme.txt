So my friend asked me to simplify a program she doesn't understand.

The program uji.cpp is simplified to fixed.cpp

Define simplify: So uji.cpp is using iostream function such as cin and cout which my friend doesn't understand (yet), so i changed 
                that into scanf and printf which is more understandable to programming newbie. I also made the source code more readable.
                Despite it is simplified, the output is still lack of indentation. 
                
This program is simple cashier program that can be used in restaurants or cafe.


Enjoy :)
